Regression & Hypothesis Testing (PanelOLS)

Model:
Two-way fixed effects panel regression with state fixed effects and month fixed effects.
Outcome: residential price (cents/kWh).
Exposure: data center load intensity (MW per million kWh of residential sales).
Controls: log(1+generation), fuel mix shares (renew omitted baseline), fuel cost proxy.

Estimation:
- PanelOLS with EntityEffects + TimeEffects
- SEs: two-way clustered by state and month
- N=1671 across 51 states and 34 months

Result:
beta=0.867527 (SE=0.540843)
two-sided p=0.108908
one-sided p=0.054454 → fail to reject H0 at alpha=0.05

Effect size (P25→P75 exposure):
Δx=0.119246 implies Δprice≈0.1034 cents/kWh
(95% CI≈[-0.0231, 0.2300])
